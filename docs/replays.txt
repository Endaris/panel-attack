Replay Files

"in_buf" and "I" represent P1's and P2's inputs, respectively. Every character represents a frame.

Inputs are mapped to binary values.
0 - (do nothing)
1 - Right
2 - Left
4 - Down
8 - Up
16 - Swap
32 - Raise Stack

There are 64 legal case-sensitive characters that can be put in a Replay, which are:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890+/

Using math, you can figure out what inputs go to each character by adding them together. These characters follow an index order, so consider them 0-63. 

For example, let's say that a player is inputting both down and right at the same time. Right is equal to 1, and Down is equal to 4. Therefore, we would add them both together (1 + 4 = 5) to reach the letter "F". (Remember that since we are dealing with indexes, we start counting at 0).

Common actions:

A = Do nothing
B = Move Right
C = Move Left
E = Move Down
I = Move Up
Q = Swap
g = Raise Stack

"P" and "O" represent P1's and P2's stacks, respectively.
